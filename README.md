# imageGen

## Overview

imageGen is a forensic image file generator designed to assist forensic analysts in creating test scenarios or generating sample data for their investigations. This tool is particularly useful for generating a variety of image files (JPG, PDF, TXT, XLSX, etc.) that can be used in forensic analysis.

As this is meant to be an artifact from a group project, it's capabilities at this point is fairly barebones. The image generator doesn't acually generate image files, but instead it generates a set amount of random files in the so far supported file formats.
